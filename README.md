# README

Vending Machine app.

*This is a work in progress.*

# Spec
Design a vending machine using a programming language of your choice. The vending machine should perform as follows:

Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product.
It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted.
The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be of denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2.
There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.
The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.​
